# Week-9-Project-Pentesting-Live-Targets
Attempt to find and exploit the vulnerabilities of Globitek


# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:

* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each color is vulnerable to only 2 of the 6 possible exploits. First discover which color has the specific vulnerability, then write a short description of how to exploit it, and finally demonstrate it using screenshots compiled into a GIF.

## Blue

Vulnerability #1:SQL Injection: Most of the data input received by these websites is being sanitized properly. However, one of the three sites has one place where the input is not being sanitized before being used in an SQL query. Determine which color has the vulnerability.

Description: Input in green and red is sanitized meanwhile blue results in "Database query failed"

Vulnerability #2: __________________

## Green

Vulnerability #1: Username Enumeration: A careless developer mistake has created a username enumeration vulnerability. Determine which color has the vulnerability. You can use the existing username "jmonroe99" as a test. Next, figure out what mistake the developer made.

Description: When username "jmonroe99" is typed, "Log in unsuccessful is bolded", when a non existent username is typed it is not.

Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Scripting: All three sites do a good job of protecting against a reflected XSS attack. However, one of the sites has a mistake which leaves the site vulnerable to a stored XSS attack. A reflected XSS attack would be easy to reveal, while a stored XSS does not provide instant feedback. You will need to log into the admin area and look through the CMS in order to "spring the trap" and find out if your attack succeeded. Determine which color has the vulnerability. Remember, others will be attacking these sites alongside you. Use your name in the XSS so that your results won't be confused with anyone else's (example: <script>alert('Mallory found the XSS!');</script>).

Description: Injected script in the contact information of Green Website

## Red

Vulnerability #1: 2. Insecure Direct Object Reference: One of the three sites is missing code which would prevent some sensitive information from being made public. Determine which color has the vulnerability. Then, figure out what the other two sites did correctly to prevent the information leak.

Description: When modifying the ID for the Find a SalesPerson Tab, after ID 10 we get information leaked.
