# Week-9-Project-Pentesting-Live-Targets
Attempt to find and exploit the vulnerabilities of Globitek


# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:

* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each color is vulnerable to only 2 of the 6 possible exploits. First discover which color has the specific vulnerability, then write a short description of how to exploit it, and finally demonstrate it using screenshots compiled into a GIF.

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: __________________

## Green

Vulnerability #1: 1. Username Enumeration: A careless developer mistake has created a username enumeration vulnerability. Determine which color has the vulnerability. You can use the existing username "jmonroe99" as a test. Next, figure out what mistake the developer made.

Description: When username "jmonroe99" is typed, "Log in unsuccessful is bolded", when a non existent username is typed it is not.

## Red

Vulnerability #1: 2. Insecure Direct Object Reference: One of the three sites is missing code which would prevent some sensitive information from being made public. Determine which color has the vulnerability. Then, figure out what the other two sites did correctly to prevent the information leak.
Description: When modifying the ID for the Find a SalesPerson Tab, after ID 10 we get information leaked.
