# Week-9-Project-Pentesting-Live-Targets
Attempt to find and exploit the vulnerabilities of Globitek


# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:

* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each color is vulnerable to only 2 of the 6 possible exploits. First discover which color has the specific vulnerability, then write a short description of how to exploit it, and finally demonstrate it using screenshots compiled into a GIF.

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: __________________

Vulnerability #2: __________________

## Green

Vulnerability #1: 1. Username Enumeration: A careless developer mistake has created a username enumeration vulnerability. Determine which color has the vulnerability. You can use the existing username "jmonroe99" as a test. Next, figure out what mistake the developer made.

Description: When username "jmonroe99" is typed, "Log in unsuccessful is bolded", when a non existent username is typed it is not.
